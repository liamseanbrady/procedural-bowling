Problem scope:
  Create a bowling game
  Game has two players
  Basic game has 10 frames
  Each frame has two balls unless the first ball is a strike
  If the ball is a spare on the 10th frame, you get an extra ball
  If the ball is a strike on the 10th frame, you get two extra balls
  If a player gets a spare then the score for that frame is 10 plus the next ball
